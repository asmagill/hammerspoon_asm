By using a combination of private APIs and Accessibility hacks (via hs.axuielement), some basic functions for controlling the use of Spaces is possible with Hammerspoon, but there are some limitations and caveats.\n\nIt should be noted that while the functions provided by this module have worked for some time in third party applications and in a previous experimental module that has received limited testing over the last few years, they do utilize some private APIs which means that Apple could change them at any time.\n\nThe functions which allow you to create new spaes, remove spaces, and jump to a specific space utilize `hs.axuielement` and perform accessibility actions through the Dock application to manipulate Mission Control. Because we are essentially directing the Dock to perform User Interactions, there is some visual feedback which we cannot entirely suppress. You can minimize, but not entirely remove, this by enabling \"Reduce motion\" in System Preferences -> Accessibility -> Display.\n\nIt is recommended that you also enable \"Displays have separate Spaces\" in System Preferences -> Mission Control.\n\nThis module is a distillation of my previous `hs._asm.undocumented.spaces` module, changes inspired by reviewing the `Yabai` source, and some experimentation with `hs.axuielement`. If you require more sophisticated control, I encourage you to check out https:\/\/github.com\/koekeishiya\/yabai -- it does require some additional setup (changes to SIP, possibly edits to `sudoers`, etc.) but may be worth the extra steps for some power users. A Spoon supporting direct socket communication with Yabai from Hammerspoon is also being considered.",
