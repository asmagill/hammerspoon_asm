hs.canvas.turtle
================

An experimental module to add a turtle graphics module to `hs.canvas` in Hammerspoon.

This module creates a "canvas" that responds to turtle graphics like commands similar to those found in the Logo language, specifically [BERKELEY LOGO 6.1](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/docs/html/usermanual_6.html#GRAPHICS).

This may or may not ever make it into Hammerspoon itself; it was a diversion and an attempt to revisit some algorithms I worked on to explore Sierpi≈Ñski curves in an old Hypercard stack I created in my teens.
