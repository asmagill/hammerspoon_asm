    "doc" : "A minimal and very basic Objective-C bridge for Hammerspoon\n\nThis module provides a way to craft Objective-C messages and create or manipulate native Objective-C objects from within Hammerspoon.  It is very experimental, very limited, and probably not safe for you or your computer.\n\nThis module is not intended to replace a properly written and targeted module coded in Objective-C, or another language.  For one, it will never be as efficient or as fast, since everything is evaluated and crafted at run-time.  This module can however be used as a testing ground and a \"proof-of-concept\" environment when deciding if a particular module is worth developing.  And there may be the occasional one-off that seems useful, but doesn't quite justify a full module in it's own right.\n\nStandard disclaimers apply, including but not limited to, do not use this in production, what part of \"experimental\" didn't you understand?, and I am not responsible for anything this module does or does not do to or for you, your computer, your data, your dog, or anything else.\n\nIf you want safe, then do not use this module.  If you're curious and like to poke at things that might poke back, then I hope that this module can provide you with as much entertainment and amusement, and the occasional insight, as developing it has for me.\n\n\n\n**Known limitations, unsupported features and data types (for arguments and return values), and things being considered:**\n\n  * Methods with a variable number of arguments (vararg) -- this is not supported by NSInvocation, so is not likely to ever be supported without a substantial (and very non-trivial) re-write.\n  * C style union arguments -- this is not supported by NSInvocation, so is not likely to ever be supported without a substantial (and very non-trivial) re-write.\n  * C style array arguments and return types are not currently supported (NSArray objects as arguments and return types are supported, however).  This is likely to be added for fixed-size array's in the future.\n  * C style bitfields -- if the encoding type of a method signature specifies the flags as bitfields, this is currently not supported.  If the flags are specified as one or more integer types in the encoding, they are.  I have not come across an actual bitfield designation in a method encoding yet; however the specification defined at https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/mac\/documentation\/Cocoa\/Conceptual\/ObjCRuntimeGuide\/Articles\/ocrtTypeEncodings.html does allow for them.  This will be considered if and when it becomes necessary.\n  * objects and data types referred to by reference (pointer) as arguments or a return type -- except for C style character arrays, which have their own designated encoding type, these are not currently supported.  Where it is possible to determine the pointers destination size and\/or type, this may be added (for example, specifying an NSError object by reference in an argument list to a method).  However, where the destination type and\/or size cannot be precisely determined, this is likely to never be supported because it would create a very fragile and crash prone environment.\n  * unknown objects (those specified with a type encoding of ?) are not likely to ever be supported for similar reasons to those stated for objects by reference above.\n\n  * Structure support is currently limited to those recognized by LuaSkin (currently a WIP, pull #825) or that can be fully stored as an NSValue with a static objC encoding type and stored in a packed format.  Lua 5.3's `string.pack` appears to recognize most of the type encoding specifiers and the internal storage of this data, so it is likely that a more robust and seamless solution will be added in the near future. Structures with pointers to data not fully contained within the packed data are not likely to ever be supported.\n\n* Property qualifiers as specified in the Encoding specification provided by Apple at the URL above -- these include specifiers for: const, in, inout, out, bycopy, byref, and oneway.  Currently these are just ignored.\n  * Any value which can be presented as a basic lua data type (boolean, numeric, string, table) is \"copied\" into the Lua environment -- the value available to Hammerspoon\/Lua is a copy of what the value was when it was queried.\n  * Objective-C objects (id instances) are represented in Lua as userdata, and the Objective-C retain count is adjusted indicating that Hammerspoon has a strong reference to the object.  While this has not posed a problem in early testing (except perhaps in the form of memory leaks when an object has lost all references except for the Hammerspoon userdata strong reference), this really should be fixed at some point so that property attributes and qualifiers are honored.\n\n  * Accessing ivar values directly -- currently not supported.  Most instance variables are just the backing for a property and you should access them as property objects or with class getter and setter methods.  Most \"best practices\" for Objective-C coding generally recommend against using instance variables directly, especially in an ARC environment; however some older frameworks and specific coding situations still use instance variables without the supporting property structures.  Support for direct examination and manipulation of ivar's may be added if a compelling reason occurs -- I just haven't found anything worth examining yet that justifies the testing and troubleshooting!\n\n  * Creating an Objective-C class at run-time with Hammerspoon\/Lua as the language\/environment of the class methods.  An interesting idea, but not one I have had the time to play with yet.  I don't know if this will be added or not because even if it is feasible to do so, it will still be significantly slower than anything coded directly in Objective-C or Swift.  Still, since this module is for playing around, who knows if the bug will bite hard enough to make a go at it :-]",
