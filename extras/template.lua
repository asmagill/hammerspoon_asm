--- === {PATH}.{MODULE} ===
---
--- This module provides extras that will someday be a real boy.  But for now I want them in a consistent place before I have decided where they belong.
---
--- I include these here for my convenience but they will be moved if a proper home is discovered for them where inclusion as a public function makes sense.  I will try to make it clear if something moves on the github repo where this ends up, but expect to need to make changes as these functions/tools become real.

I found a dev file concerning this once, but forgot to link it, so I'll add that here when I find it again.

--- {PATH}.{MODULE}.hexDump(string [, count]) -> string
--- Function
--- Treats the input string as a binary blob and returns a prettied up hex dump of it's contents. By default, a newline character is inserted after every 16 bytes, though this can be changed by also providing the optional count argument.  This is useful with the results of `{PATH}.{MODULE}.userDataToString` or `string.dump` for debugging and the curious, and may also provide some help with troubleshooting utf8 data that is being mis-handled or corrupted.

--- {PATH}.{MODULE}.sortedKeys(table[ , function]) -> function
--- Function
--- Iterator for getting keys from a table in a sorted order. Provide function 'f' as per _Programming_In_Lua,_3rd_ed_, page 52; otherwise order is ascii order ascending. (e.g. `function(m,n) return not (m < n) end` would result in reverse order.
---
--- Similar to Perl's sort(keys %hash).  Use like this: `for i,v in {PATH}.{MODULE}.sortedKeys(t[, f]) do ... end`

--- {PATH}.{MODULE}.mtTools[...]
--- Variable
--- An array containing useful functions for metatables in a single location for reuse.  Use as `setmetatable(myTable, { __index = {PATH}.{MODULE}.mtTools })`
--- Currently defined:
---     myTable:get("path.key" [, default])      -- Retrieve a value for key at the specified path in (possibly nested) table, or a default value, if it doesn't exist.  Note that "path" can be arbitrarily deeply nested tables (e.g. path.p2.p3. ... .pN).
---     myTable:set("path.key", value [, build]) -- Set value for key at the specified path in table, building up the tables along the way, if build argument is true.   Note that "path" can be arbitrarily deeply nested tables (e.g. path.p2.p3. ... .pN).

                    root = root[part]
                else
                    error("Part "..part.." of "..key_path.." either exists and is not a table, or does not exist and build not set to true.", 2)

}

--- {PATH}.{MODULE}.asciiOnly(string[, all]) -> string
--- Function
--- Returns the provided string with all non-printable ascii characters (except for Return, Linefeed, and Tab unless `all` is provided and is true) escaped as \x## so that it can be safely printed in the {TARGET} console, rather than result in an uninformative '(null)'.  Note that this will break up Unicode characters into their individual bytes.
function module.asciiOnly(theString, all)
    local all = all or false
    if all then
        return (theString:gsub("[\x00-\x1f\x7f-\xff]",function(a)

                return string.format("\\x%02X",string.byte(a))
            end))

end

--- {PATH}.{MODULE}.fnutils_every(table, fn) -> bool
--- Function
--- Returns true if the application of fn on every entry in table is truthy.
function module.fnutils_every(table, fn)
    for k, v in pairs(table) do
        if not fn(v, k) then return false end
    end

--- {PATH}.{MODULE}.fnutils_some(table, fn) -> bool
--- Function
--- Returns true if the application of fn on entries in table are truthy for at least one of the members.
function module.fnutils_some(table, fn)
    local function is_invalid(v, k)
        return not fn(v, k)
    end
    return not module.fnutils_every(table, is_invalid)
end

--- {PATH}.{MODULE}.exec(command[, with_user_env]) -> output, status, type, rc
--- Function
--- Runs a shell command and returns stdout as a string (may include a trailing newline), followed by true or nil indicating if the command completed successfully, the exit type ("exit" or "signal"), and the result code.
---
---  If `with_user_env` is `true`, then invoke the user's default shell as an interactive login shell in which to execute the provided command in order to make sure their setup files are properly evaluated so extra path and environment variables can be set.  This is not done, if `with_user_env` is `false` or not provided, as it does add some overhead and is not always strictly necessary.
module.exec = function(command, user_env)
    local f
    if user_env then
        f = io.popen(os.getenv("SHELL").." -l -i -c \""..command.."\"", 'r')

    return s, status, exit_type, rc
end

--- {PATH}.{MODULE}.restart()
--- Function
--- Completely restart {TARGET} by actually quitting the application and then reopening it.  Default pause to allow for a complete shutdown of {TARGET}  is 2 seconds, but you can adjust this by using the `settings` module to set "_asm.sleepCount" to your desired wait time.
module.restart = function()
    sleepCount = ((mjolnir and require("mjolnir._asm.settings")) or (hs and require("hs.settings"))).get("_asm.restartSleep") or 2
    os.execute("(sleep "..sleepCount.." ; open -a "..module._paths.bundlePath..") &")
    {BASE}._exit("What is this argument for?",true)
-- Oh... from the lua docs... os.exit ([code [, close]):
-- Calls the ANSI C function exit to terminate the host program. If code is true, the returned status is EXIT_SUCCESS; if code is false, the returned status is EXIT_FAILURE; if code is a number, the returned status is this number. The default value for code is true.
-- If the optional second argument close is true, closes the Lua state before exiting.
end

--- {PATH}.{MODULE}.versionCompare(v1, v2) -> bool
--- Function
--- Compare version strings and return `true` if v1 < v2, otherwise false.
---
--- Note that this started out for comparing luarocks version numbers, but should work for many cases. The basics are listed below.
---
--- Luarocks version numbers: x(%.y)*-z
---      x and y are probably numbers... but maybe not... z is a number
---
--- More generically, we actually accept _ or . as a separator, but only 1 - to keep with the luarocks spec.
---
--- Our rules for testing:
--- 1. if a or b start with "v" or "r" followed immediately by a number, drop the letter.
--- 2. break apart into x(%.y)* and z (we actually allow the same rules on z as we do for the first part, but if I understand the rockspec correctly, this should never actually happen)
--- 3. first compare the x(%.y)* part.  If they are the same, only then compare the z part.
---
--- Repeat the following for each part:
--- 1. if the version matches so far, and a has more components, then return a > b. e.g. 3.0.1 > 3.0 (of course 3.0.0 > 3.0 as well... should that change?)
--- 2. If either part n of a or part n of b cannot be successfully changed to a number, compare as strings. Otherwise compare as numbers.
---
--- This does mean that the following probably won't work correctly, but at
--- least with luarocks, none have been this bad yet...
---
---     3.0 "should" be > then a release candidate: 3.0rc
---     3.0rc2 and 3.0.rc1 (inconsistent lengths of parts)
---     3.0.0 aren't 3.0 "equal" (should they be?)
---     "dev" should be before "alpha" or "beta"
---     "final" should be after "rc" or "release"
---     dates as version numbers that aren't yyyymmdd
---     runs of 0's (tonumber("00") == tonumber("000"))
---     "1a" and "10a"
---
---     others?
